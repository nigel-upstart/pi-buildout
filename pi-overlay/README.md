# Pi `/skills` TypeScript overlay

The authored form of the `/skills` runtime patch. Reviewed TypeScript here is the source of truth; the artifacts under
`patches/pi-<version>/` are generated from it.

## Layout

| Path                                   | What it is                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `skill-management-core.ts`             | All original logic, including the interactive `/skills` command body. Imports nothing — Node built-ins and Pi's own helpers arrive through the injected `SkillEnvironment` seam. |
| `skill-management.ts`                  | The Pi-facing shell. The only file that names Pi modules; it binds the real implementations and keeps each export's signature identical to what Pi's call sites use.             |
| `skill-management-core.test.mjs`       | Focused unit tests over the core, using a fake environment. No real filesystem, no real git.                                                                                     |
| `versions/<version>/integration.patch` | The seam edits against upstream `packages/coding-agent` TypeScript source.                                                                                                       |
| `versions/<version>/replacements/`     | Files copied verbatim over the published package, not built from source.                                                                                                         |

## Why the core/shell split

Pi's source imports its own modules with `.ts` specifiers (`../config.ts`), enforced upstream by
`npm run check:ts-relative-imports`. Those specifiers resolve only inside a Pi source tree. Keeping every upstream
reference in one thin shell means:

- `skill-management-core.ts` type-checks and unit-tests inside this repository with no stubs and no loader tricks, under
  the repo's normal `strictTypeChecked` ESLint and `tsc --noEmit` gates;
- `skill-management.ts` is type-checked where it actually lives, by upstream's own `tsgo` against real upstream types,
  during patch generation. It is excluded from this repo's `tsconfig.json` and ESLint config because its imports cannot
  resolve here.

Hand-written `.d.ts` stubs were considered and rejected: they drift from upstream and prove less than compiling against
the real thing.

Keep the shell as thin as it can be. Because it is outside this repository's ESLint and `tsc` runs, anything that lives
there is checked only by upstream's compiler — no strict lint rules, no complexity limit. Logic put there and later
moved into the core has arrived carrying lint errors more than once. New logic belongs in `skill-management-core.ts`;
the shell should only bind and forward.

## Minimal seam policy

New logic goes in `skill-management*.ts`. Upstream files get imports and a call site, nothing more.

Measured against each clean package, edits to pre-existing upstream files:

| Pre-existing upstream file                   | 1.0.3  | 1.0.4  | 1.1.0  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `dist/core/resource-loader.js`               | 16     | 16     | 16     |
| `dist/core/slash-commands.js`                | 1      | 1      | 1      |
| `dist/main.js`                               | 5      | 5      | 5      |
| `dist/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.js` | 26     | 26     | 26     |
| **Total**                                    | **48** | **48** | **48** |

The supported seams make the same calls and compile the shared `skill-management-core.ts` and `skill-management.ts` to
byte-identical `dist/core/skill-management*.js`.

The budget counts only files where upstream code is edited in place. Files the patch _adds_ are ours; `docs/skills.md`
and the two bundled entrypoints are replaced wholesale rather than surgically edited, so none of them belong in a number
meant to track how much upstream code we reach into. The generation pipeline enforces the total as
`maxUpstreamEditedLines` in `versions/<version>/upstream.json`, so the policy is a build failure rather than a review
convention.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- `DefaultResourceLoader` no longer gains any skill-specific API. The five methods the earlier patch added to it —
  `getActiveSkillPaths`, `invalidateSkillCatalogCache`, `normalizeSkillEntry`, `resolveSkillEntry`,
  `findCatalogSkillPath` — are free functions here. Interactive session scope resolves entries through this module too,
  rather than reaching into the loader.
- The catalog cache is now local to `resolveActiveSkillPaths`. It was only ever reachable from one call path (`reload()`
  → `getActiveSkillPaths()` → `resolveSkillEntry()`), so an instance field and its invalidation were never reused across
  calls. Behaviour is unchanged; the end-to-end catalog test is the check on that.

## Delivery: why a patch rather than copying files in

The installer already delivers `dist/core/skill-management.js` as a _new_ file, through a `--- /dev/null` hunk tracked
by `baseline.absent` and `patched.sha256`. A file added through the patch **is** a copied-in file — it simply travels
through a channel that already has checksum verification, atomic replacement with rollback, refusal on unknown or mixed
state, and upgrade migrations. A second copy mechanism would duplicate that machinery and lose the verification.

Registering `/skills` from a Pi **extension** was evaluated and rejected. The extension API does offer
`registerCommand()` and `ctx.reload()`, but `ExtensionContext` exposes no resource loader, no `getSkills`, and no
`additionalSkillPaths`. An extension therefore cannot implement session scope, cannot make skills opt-in at all — which
is the whole point of the `resource-loader` change — and cannot serve non-interactive `pi skills …`. Worth revisiting if
Pi ever exposes the resource loader to extensions.

## Source acquisition

Per version, `versions/<version>/upstream.json` pins the inputs. Two properties make this reproducible:

- **The exact upstream commit is published.** The npm registry records `gitHead` for every release, and it matches the
  revisions in `ATTRIBUTION.md` exactly (`1.0.3` → `d78dc83d633229d12f8b79631384c4c2717c399f`, `1.0.4` →
  `7c10bd4337495ee613f2224843ecdf349b80d1df`, `1.1.0` → `abe508e1b89912adde45528136c3221eb69acdd7`).
- **Upstream ships a deterministic source archive.** Each GitHub release carries `pi-<version>-source.tar.gz` (built by
  upstream's `scripts/create-source-archive.sh`) alongside a `SHA256SUMS`. GitHub's _auto-generated_ tag tarballs are
  not byte-stable and are deliberately not used.

A git submodule was rejected: it vendors the whole tree for no reproducibility gain. A long-lived fork was rejected as
unjustified unless we intend to contribute to or maintain an upstream branch. Upstream is MIT; this repository vendors
no upstream source.

## Reproducibility

For 1.0.3, 1.0.4, and 1.1.0, the clean build reproduces all four pre-existing runtime files tracked by each patch
byte-for-byte before the overlay is applied. No normalization is applied. If that ever stops holding, generation fails
rather than emitting a patch carrying toolchain noise.

The pipeline never rebuilds `dist/bundle/` or its content-hashed chunks. It replaces `cli-runtime.js` and `rpc-entry.js`
with the small wrappers in `replacements/`; baseline hashes come from the npm tarball. The published
`dist/bundle/cli.js` loader keeps Node's compile cache and `require()` dispatch. It is declared with
`"source": "unchanged"`: both checksum manifests pin it, so a loader that bypasses the replaced runtime is rejected. Pi
1.1.0's RPC wrapper preserves upstream's process markers and HTTP-dispatcher setup.

`workspaceBuildOrder` follows upstream's root build script. Pi 1.0.3 builds `packages/codemode`, `packages/mcp`, and
`packages/durable` before the agent package. Pi 1.0.4 and 1.1.0 also build `packages/env` before `packages/agent`.

`npm run patches:build` and `npm run patches:check` pass `--all`, so every version under `versions/` is regenerated and
checked, not only the one the development dependencies pin. Use `node scripts/build-pi-patch.mjs --version <version>`
for a single version.

Pi 1.0.3, 1.0.4, and 1.1.0 build with the released `typescript` `7.0.2` (`tsc`). If a pinned compiler is withdrawn or
its emit changes, reproducibility breaks; the scheduled drift job is the detector.
