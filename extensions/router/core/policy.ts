 * MiniMax M2.5, admitted to the bounded read-only ladders only.

 * Multilingual, the one source measuring both, it leads Haiku by 3.8 points of mean resolve over eight
 * languages (68.6% against 64.8%), costs 3.9x less per resolved task ($0.155 against $0.612), and uses
 * fewer median API calls (62.6 against 67.6). On SWE-bench Verified it leads gpt-oss-120b by 49.8
 * points at 2.3x lower cost per resolved task.
 *
 * Its evidence is single-attempt, so `singleAttemptEvidence` confines it to read-only consequence.
 * That flag, not its ability band, is what keeps it away from mutating work: the band derived from
 * this source is 2, which would otherwise clear the irreversible floor.
 *
 * It is declared in the fallback chain and never as a declared primary. It is deliberately NOT
 * forcibly demoted at selection time, so if every rung ahead of it is ineligible - Luna unavailable,
 * for instance - it can become the selected primary of a read-only route. That is intended, and the
 * contrast with `escalationOnly` is the reason: that flag is demoted unconditionally because its
 * candidate has a *measured* unfitness for a first attempt, 52.7% same-task flakiness. Here the
 * problem is absence of evidence, not measured unreliability, and the only alternative in that state
 * is the rung this one displaced - which measures worse on every axis the sources share. Forcing a
 * non-single-attempt primary would mean deliberately choosing the worse-measured model. Being first on
 * read-only work is also no more dangerous than being second on it, because the confinement above is
 * what bounds the damage, not the position in the chain.
 *
 * Haiku is retained behind it rather than replaced. The reason is availability, not capability: this
 * endpoint is text-only, so an image-bearing bounded task excludes it on the capability gate, and
 * Haiku is then the cheapest image-capable rung before the ladder jumps to gpt-5.6-terra at roughly
 * 2.4x its effective rate. Ordering MiniMax first is safe precisely because that gate handles the
 * exception without ordering having to.
 *
 * `low` follows the rung it displaces. No source measures this model per effort — the submissions ran
 * at a "high reasoning" setting and measured agentic repository work, not bounded classification — so
 * the effort is chosen to match the rung rather than claimed as measured.
