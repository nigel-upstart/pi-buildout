# `/effort`

Provides a TUI picker for pi's thinking level. Passing an exact supported level (for example, `/effort medium`) applies
it immediately to the current session without opening the picker. The picker can apply a selection only to the current
session or also update the global `defaultThinkingLevel` setting. Unknown arguments show a warning before opening the
picker.

## Install

Run `scripts/install-extensions.sh` from the repository root, then use `/reload` in pi.

## Test

```bash
node --test extensions/effort/index.test.mjs
```
