# pi 1.5.2 `/skills` patch

Version-specific opt-in skill activation for the published `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent@1.5.2`. Configured global and trusted-project directories, packages, and settings form a catalog; only explicitly activated skills enter the prompt. The authored TypeScript lives in [`pi-overlay/`](../../pi-overlay); the patch and checksum manifests here are generated.

## Rebuild and verification

```bash
npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org node scripts/build-pi-patch.mjs --version 1.5.2
npm_config_registry=https://registry.npmjs.org node scripts/build-pi-patch.mjs --version 1.5.2 --check
npm test
```

The pinned release archive, published checksum, npm tarball, source revision, workspace build order, and tracked files are in [`upstream.json`](../../pi-overlay/versions/1.5.2/upstream.json). The builder compares the unmodified source build with the published runtime before generating a patch, enforces the 48-line upstream seam budget, applies the patch to a clean package, and verifies every resulting checksum. Do not apply this patch to another Pi version.

- `skills.patch` changes the unbundled resource loader, CLI and interactive dispatch, and skill documentation; it adds the shared skill-management modules and replaces bundled CLI and RPC runtime entrypoints.
- `baseline.sha256` and `baseline.absent` specify the required clean state. `patched.sha256` pins the result, including the unchanged `dist/bundle/cli.js` loader.
- The unchanged loader enables Node's compile cache and loads the replaced `dist/bundle/cli-runtime.js`; RPC uses the replaced `dist/bundle/rpc-entry.js`. The installer verifies baseline and result and refuses unknown or mixed states. `pre-expansion-patched.sha256` and `pre-expansion-upgrade.patch` recognize this fork's previously shipped patch and upgrade it in place. Unknown or mixed states remain rejected.

## Portable skill paths

For the one-shot CLI, quote variable-based paths so the shell does not expand them before Pi receives them, for example `pi skills add '$SKILL_ROOT/review' --global`. Interactive `/skills` arguments do not pass through a shell.

Path sources support `~`, `$NAME`, and `${NAME}`. Portable spellings expand whenever skills load or reload; unset references stay literal and produce useful diagnostics if the path cannot resolve. Checkout-local `--repo` paths persist relative to the repository root, so trusted clones and worktrees with the same remote use their own checkout. Checkout-relative entries are not activated until that checkout is trusted. Other paths retain portable spellings or persist absolute (under `~` inside the home directory); `$PWD`/`$OLDPWD` paths are frozen. Equivalent resolved paths match activation and removal. Existing absolute configuration entries are unchanged; remove and re-add to make them portable.

The migration was generated from this fork's actual pre-expansion tree, including its trust-scoped CLI behavior, not upstream's generated checksums.

## Drift from 1.5.0

The 1.5.2 seam is the 1.5.0 seam, rebased. No overlay logic changed, and the patch makes the same 48 edited lines in the same four upstream files.

- `integration.patch` changes only hunk positions and blob indexes. The CLI import and dispatch hunks move by 3 and 37 lines; the interactive imports, command dispatch, and handler hunks move by 8, 64, and 86 lines. The patch is regenerated from the 1.5.2 sources and applies without offset or fuzz.
- Upstream `src/core/resource-loader.ts`, `src/core/slash-commands.ts`, `src/core/skills.ts`, `src/core/project-trust.ts`, and `docs/skills.md` are byte-identical to 1.5.0. The skill loading, catalog, and trust APIs used by the overlay are unchanged.
- `main.ts` adds auth login/logout dispatch and missing-session-directory fork handling; interactive mode adds session-fork choices and other UI changes. These remain upstream behavior, not overlay implementations. The skills dispatch stays between existing early commands and argument parsing; the interactive skills handler still delegates reload to upstream.
- `src/cli.ts`, `src/rpc-entry.ts`, `src/cli/setup.ts`, and the published `dist/bundle/cli.js` loader are unchanged from 1.5.0. The `cli-runtime.js` and `rpc-entry.js` wrappers are reused byte-for-byte. Baseline hashes pin the new published bundled runtimes.
- The workspace build order and TypeScript 7.0.2 toolchain are unchanged. The shared `skill-management*.js` output and patched `docs/skills.md` are byte-identical to 1.5.0.
- The npm registry publishes no `gitHead` for 1.5.2. The manifest records the commit that the `v1.5.2` release tag points to.

## Runtime behavior tests

Provide a clean, unpatched Pi 1.5.2 package with `package.json`, `dist/`, `docs/`, and resolvable `node_modules/`:

```bash
PI_SKILLS_TEST_PACKAGES=/path/to/pi-1.5.2/package npm test
PI_SKILLS_TEST_PACKAGES=/path/to/pi-1.5.2/package \
  node --test --test-name-pattern='pi 1\.5\.2' scripts/skills-catalog.test.mjs
```

The directory must match `baseline.sha256` and `baseline.absent`. The tests copy and patch it in temporary directories; they do not modify the supplied package. Multiple package directories can be separated with the platform path delimiter. To prepare a package, extract the pinned npm tarball and link its `node_modules` to dependencies installed with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` from the release's checksum-verified `pi-coding-agent-install-package.json` and `pi-coding-agent-install-package-lock.json`.

The suite verifies opt-in loading, explicit `--skill` with `--no-skills`, session/global/repository activation, catalog trust and precedence, serialized configuration updates, installer idempotency and mixed-state rejection, and patch reversal. The [1.5.0 regression checks](../pi-1.5.0/README.md#150-regression-checks) for saved distrust, diagnostic labels, and path identity run against 1.5.2 too. No upstream change requires removing an overlay workaround or changing earlier versioned patches.
